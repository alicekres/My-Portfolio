            <p>
                At the moment I'm a tech trainee at futureproof and live in
                small peaceful town in south-west of England.

                I was born and raised in Estonia. As I loved to take care of
                people and bring them joy - I decided to study nursing. After
                finishing studies I moved to England where I worked as a nurse
                for a time.

                However, my husband who works as a front-end developer sparked
                an interest in me for programming. He often after finishing a
                task was happily showing it to me, being so excited and proud of
                what he had been able to solve. By nature I'm curious and I
                started to find out what my husband was working on and trying to
                understand the concept of programming. At first it was just for
                fun but as the time went on I realized that I'd like to try that
                opportunity to study programming.

                I started with simple courses in youtube by netninja about css,
                html, and javascript. After that I took on courses at Udemy and
                built my very first project based on the course by Maximilian
                Shwartzm√ºller using JavaScript, React and NextJs. After that I
                started my studies at futureproof where we are covering large
                area of technologies and most importantly simulate the working
                environment, using agile working environment with stand-ups,
                retros, collaboration and solving and/or trying to avoid merging
                conflicts.
