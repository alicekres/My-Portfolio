                    I was born and raised in Estonia. As I loved to take care of
                    people and bring them joy - I decided to study nursing.
                    After finishing studies I moved to England where I worked as
                    a nurse for a little while.

                    However, my husband who works as a front-end developer
                    sparked an interest in me for programming. After finishing a
                    task he often shared with me a little bit of code. That
                    excitement got me curious and I started to find out more. At
                    first it was just for fun but as the time went on I realized
                    that I'd like to study programming more seriously.

                    I started with simple courses in YouTube by The Net Ninja
                    about HTML, CSS and JavaScript. After that I took on courses
                    at Udemy and built my very first project based on the course
                    by Maximilian Shwartzm√ºller using JavaScript, React and
                    NextJs. This first project was challenging for me as
                    everything I did was new and at times confusing. However, I
                    liked the process to create my own page. That project
                    allowed me to attain greater knowledge and understanding of
                    what it means to actually sit behind computer and solve
                    issues, to implement creativity and having patience to
                    finish the project.

                    The next step for me was to leave independent studies at
                    home and move on and try working with others. I was able to
                    find an amazing opportunity at futureproof where we are
                    covering many programming technologies and languages like
                    JavaScript, React, Redux, Docker to name the few. Most
                    importantly we are simulating the working environment, using
                    agile working environment with stand-ups, retros,
                    collaboration and using tools like Git/Github, KanBan boards
                    and others.

                    I'm looking forward to working in a friendly atmosphere
                    where growing and challenges are part of everyday life and
                    where I can contribute with my knowledge that I have
                    aquired.
